# Jace's React Todo App

##
Practicing React. This Todo app should be able to add tasks, delete, as well as catagorize whether they've been completed or not.


### Dev Notes
* In my Form.js submitTodoHandler for the ID I used Math.random to assign it. This is not best practice for apps meant to be published.
    * Solution: install package to get unique number...?
